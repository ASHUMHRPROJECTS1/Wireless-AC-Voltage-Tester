**Story :-**

**This is a very interesting and easy to make project. This device will
detect whether there is any current or not from a quite long range. This
project is known as \"Wireless Voltage tester\" \"Wireless Voltage
tester\"**

> By following this guide, you will be able to know and make your
> Wireless Voltage Tester This project guide contains the files necessary
> to help you step by step produce your own Wireless Voltage Tester
> Please follow the steps of the project to get a positive result.



**Step 1 :- Get your PCB ready!**

**Talking about electronics!**



> After making the circuit diagram I transformed it into a PCB design to
> produce it, to produce the PCB, I have chosen JLCPCB the best PCB
> supplier and the cheapest PCB provider to order my circuit. with the
> reliable platform, all I need to do is some simple clicks to upload
> the Gerber file and set some parameters like the PCB thickness color
> and quantity. I've paid just 2 Dollars to get my PCB after five days
> only, what I have noticed about JLCPCB this time is the
> \"out-of-charge PCB color\" which means you will pay only 2 USD for
> any PCB color you choose.

> I've got the same PCB design that we've made for our main board and
> all the labels and logos are there to guide me during the soldering
> steps. You can also download the Gerber file for this circuit from the
> download link below in case you want to place an order for the same
> circuit design.
